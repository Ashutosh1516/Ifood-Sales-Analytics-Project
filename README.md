# Ifood-Sales-Analytics-Project


Food delivery apps have exploded in popularity in recent years, offering a convenient way to satisfy our cravings. With a plethora of options available, like Swiggy, Zomato, and Doordash, the market continues to grow. As a food enthusiast with a keen interest in these services, I decided to delve into the data behind a major player: iFood.

iFood, the dominant force in Brazil's online food ordering and delivery space, boasts a staggering market share of over 80%. This project looks at sales and campaign information for iFood, a Brazilian food delivery app. By studying this data, I hope to learn more about how people use iFood and what makes their promotions successful.
